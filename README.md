## Hi there 👋

First-year engineering student. I use GitHub mainly to submit coursework, small utilities, and experiments. Nothing fancy.

Nothing active at the moment. This repository exists as a completed academic submission and reference.

I use C ,Python (occasionally), GitHub for version control and submissions
